- The major goal of creating this software is to give a forum for people to provide funding from Government or NGO. The systems maintains the entire workflow from Patient visiting the Doctor to Hospital referring the patient to Government or NGO to provide funding. The system also maintains the prescriptions provided by the doctor, test results from the Laboratory.

### Problem Statement
- The current system for requesting funds from Government or NGO is too manual. 
- People who are in need or who do not have the means to search for funds, may use our system which will help them ease their task of managing funds.
- Currently, there is no system that maintains all the doctor visits, lab results, refers for funding and approves it.

### Proposed Solution
- Providing a digital service to reduce the time and effort required for this activity
- An application is offered to a variety of organizations participating in each phase to assist them interact smoothly
- Roles and tasks that are clearly specified to aid different personnel’s from  various organizations representing their enterprises
- User friendly UI to make it easier for users to traverse the application
